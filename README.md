# Wildfire Prediction

This project aims to predict wildfires using machine learning algorithms trained on a dataset containing images of wildfire and non-wildfire scenes. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset/data).

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains code for wildfire prediction using various machine learning algorithms, including RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB, SVC, LogisticRegression, and LinearRegression. The code preprocesses the data, trains the models, evaluates their performance, and interprets the results.
